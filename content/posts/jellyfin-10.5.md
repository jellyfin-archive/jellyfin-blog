Our biggest release just yet

<!--more-->

Hello Jellyfin users out there! Welcome back to our blog!

Fasten your seat belts and get ready because the numbers are big: Since 10.4.3, **over 200 contributions** from the community were merged
and **over 500 issues** were fixed**Over 200 contributions from the community were merged and over 500 issues were fixed** both in Jellyfin and Jellyfin Web, the interface you access using your browser.

We also want to apologise for the late release: We wanted to make 10.5 possible this Christmas, but we always found that something wasn't complete or finished yet.
We hope you will forgive us after trying it (*and maybe send us some cakes*)!

Although we tried hard, there's so much packed into this release that we are still unsure if this blog post actually manages to cover all the awesome new features. We sure hope it does! Either way, there's a lot of content to cover so grab some popcorn and get ready to dive in!

# Key Features

## Let your content shine like never before

If you're like us, you probably want to have your content showcased as beautiful as possible, right? At least, everyone who contributed to the web interface were really comitted to this so it seems they wanted to:

#### Jellyfin 10.4.3

<img src="/images/10.5-release/old.png" name="Old item details page" />

#### Jellyfin 10.5

<img src="/images/10.5-release/new.png" name="New item details page" />

*With 10.5, we wanted to reimagine Jellyfin's Web interface*

Posters are now as relevant as the description of the element and backgrounds introduce you to your content. In fact, I thought that I was in the jungle when
I took that screenshot of the *The Jungle Book* wallpaper. Do you also feel it?

Also notice that the header of the UI has been reworked to have a *slightly* lighter header

Shoutout to everyone at the Web team for their invaluable contributions in making this happen, especially to *[MrTimscampi](https://github.com/mrtimscampi)* and 
*[grafixeyehero](https://github.com/grafixeyehero)*.

You can try out the redesign on our [demo server](https://demo.jellyfin.org/stable)

## Faster than the speed of sound and cleaner than a surgery room

As you might know, we are still a relatively young community and our goal is to provide the best self-hosted media server out there. Like usual, we did what we can to clean up the code and a lot of this work will pass unnoticed to many of you, but they're not any less important. I'll get to that in a moment.

Let's start with the web client, since it's the most obvious to you. A lot of work has been done to simplify the code and ease the transition
to more modern frameworks, which will be really useful in the future for making more awesome things for our clients interface. While
all the benefits of this will not be visible to you in your daily use just yet, it's a necessary step towards a better application. In fact, it already paid off in application speed. See this video:

<video autoplay muted loop preload="none" id="preview">
    <source src="/images/10.5-release/speed.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Not only it is faster, we have new animations too! Images will fade in every time you change pages. If you don't like the new animations they can be modified in settings

We finally fixed the longstanding issue many of you had with images loading slowly (which, by they way, I introduced, didn't mean to cause it!). Although the issue is no longer around, we still aren't happy with the end result and hope to further improve it going forward.

That's pretty much all for the web interface this release. The rest of the work has primarily been translations and bug fixes. Have fun finding out which ones we solved! Oh, and before I move on to the server, we added better keyboard support for TVs and improved compatibility with old browsers.

Okay, server time then! This time we focused heavily on migrating to .NET Core 3.1 which is the framework the server is built on.
Although this might be not interesting to everyone, let's see some benchmarks from the hex decoder (used in server's tasks):

```
|                         Method |     Mean |    Error |   StdDev |   Gen 0 | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Allocated |
|------------------------------- |---------:|---------:|---------:|--------:|------:|------:|----------:|
|                New hex decoder | 10.81 us | 0.079 us | 0.074 us |  0.1068 |     - |     - |     336 B |
|                Old hex decoder | 23.57 us | 0.055 us | 0.051 us | 11.2305 |     - |     - |   35272 B |
```
*Shoutout to [Bond-009](https://github.com/Bond-009) for this!*

That's only a tiny example of what we have been cooking and the groundwork preparation we've been doing for upcoming versions.
However, there are some key improvements here, which are mostly focused in performance:

* Added support for embedded attachments in media files (#1838)
* Fixed Play To order for playlists
* Raspberry Pi should have now full hardware-acceleration capabilities when encoding and decoding (older models, not in 4 yet)
* General improvements to the transcoding speed and reliability
* Reliability improvements
* Tons of bug fixes

## Extra, Extra!

Along the way, we also updated a lot of our documentation. Specifically, the experts have been working hard in revamping the **[network/reverse proxy](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/index.html)**
and the **[hardware acceleration](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration.html)** configuration guides. Not only improvements have been made, but also new sections have been added to the documentation, such
as the extensive **[codec](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/codec-support.html)** and the **[custom CSS branding](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/css-customization.html)** guides.

[Check it out!](https://jellyfin.org/docs/). With this new documentation you will probably end up with a setup we couldn't even match!

## Release Notes

All this blog post focused heavily in the server and the web client, as they're the most used ones. However, we also have a bunch of apps that will receive
this update as well, so [keep an eye](https://github.com/jellyfin) on our GitHub.

Detailed release notes available on the [GitHub's server repository](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/releases/tag/v10.5.0).

## We're not done yet

As [Joshua explained in his blog post](https://jellyfin.org/posts/jellyfin-in-2019/), we're really excited to see how our whole community is evolving,
and we're impressed by how far we've gotten since we first started. Things are going really quick, and this release just proves that.

In this post, I mentioned some of the people that contributed a lot of making this version possible. However, it's completely unfair
if only they're mentioned, as this has been a community work. That's why I want to take advantage of this blog post to say thank you, in behalf of all the project
leaders, to every single one of you out there: Big thank you to everyone in the community - not just the contributors,
sponsors, translators, reddit/matrix/forum users, but everyone who helps Jellyfin by using, translating, and encouraging people to use it: **The fact that you took some of your precious time to take a look at what we do means that you care, and that mean a lot to us.**

We're so proud of our community. It's our reason to exist and why we're way beyond where we expected a while back.

Let's keep fuelling this rocket together!

With all that said, I wish you a happy weekend and enjoy *Jellyfin*!

PS: If you are planning something for this weekend, don't you think it's a great idea to invite some of your friends/family and watch your
(now shining) new content together? Just sayin'! ðŸ˜‹
