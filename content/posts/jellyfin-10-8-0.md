After a rather long development cycle the Jellyfin team is proud to announce stable version 10.8! This release post will mostly cover the highlights with little prose, as there is so much to cover!

All of the changes, accumulated over nearly the last two years, are too many to easily list, so we'll break them down in the sections below and hope all of you find something enjoyable.

The major highlighted changes are:

 *  numerous improvements to Hardware Acceleration (HWA), including:

 **  Dolby Vision Profile 5 and 7 tone-mapping

 **  CUDA-based tone-mapping for NVIDIA

 **  extended OpenCL tone-mapping for Intel

 ** hardware based subtitle burn in

 ** Intel tone-mapping support for Windows

 ** full OpenCL filtering for AMF on Windows

 ** deprecation of OMX for raspberry pi, use V4L2 instead

 * proper network interface binding and handling of proxied requests

 * various fixes for DLNA, Sync-Play and m3u HTTP streams

 * extended NFO metadata import

 * external audio and subtitle support including container (mks, mka)

 * extended plain folder parsing

 * enhanced detection and handling of DVD/BD ISOs and folders

 * extend TMDb metadata provider (series state, season names, tags, logos, etc)

## Server
Some major fixes include a number of HWA improvements, explicit network interface binding, DLNA improvements, better NFO parsing, configuration cleanup (relics of the migrations in 10.7.z), and numerous metadata improvements, as well as the migration to .NET 6 which provides a nice stable language base for future improvements.

A point-form list of the changes compiled by the team is:

 *  General:

 ** automatically migrate and cleanup config files

 ** reduce memory footprint by various optimizations (e.g. reducing memory traffic)

 ** include genre in related media generation

 ** Implement more provider links for series, seasons, episodes and movies

 ** properly handle gif

 ** passwords are now hashed with 120000 iterations of PBKDF2-SHA512 instead of 1000 iterations of PBKDF2-SHA1, old passwords are migrated automatically on login

 ** add config option to disable automatic server discovery

 ** Networking:

 ** fix explicit IP/interface binding

 ** disable UPnP by default (only applies to new setups)

 ** proper handling of published server URLs

 * HWA:

 ** implement CUDA-based tone-mapping for NVIDIA

 ** extend Intel OpenCL tone-mapping (speed-wise on-par with VPP tone-mapping and therefore preferable)

 ** implement full OpenCL HW filtering for AMD on Windows

 ** implement hardware-based subtitle burn-in (significantly faster)

 ** implement proper tone-mapping support on Windows

 ** add CUDA & OpenCL tone-mapping support for Dolby Vision profile 5 and 8

 ** various other fixes for NVIDIA and Intel hardware acceleration

 ** add support for AV1 hardware decoding on supported platforms

 ** deprecate Raspberry Pi OMX/MMAL hardware acceleration in favour of V4L2

 * Streaming/Transcoding:

 ** optimize and extend DLNA support

 ** fixes for DLNA PlayTo and DLNA folders

 ** fixes for DLNA seeking

 ** extraction of attached fonts for subtitle transcoding/burn-in

 ** small fixes to SyncPlay

 ** add transcoding information to playback data

 ** fix opus sampling rates on transcode

 ** properly stream m3u over HTTP

 ** add keyframe extraction for better seeking (WARNING: this is a really long running task)

 ** overhaul streaming logic to only transcode incompatible streams

 ** various fmp4 fixes

 * NFO:

 ** add parsing of additional ids

 ** proper importing of watched state

 ** proper parsing of ratings

 ** proper handling of thumb tags

 ** add support for fanart tag

 * Scanner/metadata providers:

 ** add ID parsing from folder names

 ** extend ID parsing from filenames

 ** refactor extras parsing (way faster)

 ** refactor and harden parsing of plain folders (all movies in one folder)
