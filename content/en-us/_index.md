      Jellyfin lets you watch your media from a web browser on your computer, apps on your Android, iOS (including AirPlay), Android TV, or Fire TV device, or via your Chromecast or existing Kodi installation. And clients for Roku and other platforms are on the way.

  - title: It's your data.
    text:
      Jellyfin has no tracking, phone-home, or central servers collecting your data. We believe in keeping our software open and transparent, and anything we might collect (crash logs, etc.) is opt-in only. We're also not in the media business, so the only media you see is your own.

  - title: Yes, it really costs nothing.
    text:
      The Jellyfin server and clients are free to download, now and always. There are no costs, hidden or otherwise, to use Jellyfin, either for yourself, for your friends, or for your company. All our incidental costs are paid through donations from users like you.
